# RxAndroidLog
A logger with an extensible API for RxJava 
=======
(This project is still under heavy development and api may change very often and a lot in 
the coming versions).

We all know debugging RxJava's code is pretty hard, *RxAndroidLog* is a library to help with 
logging rxjava operations by providing an extensible api for logging.

Logging operations can be composed with rxjava's operation and granular control for what to log 
is provided.
